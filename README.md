As the title indicates, this course will provide a thorough understanding of the underlying principles of (modern) communication networks. We will both be studying the fundamental architectures, principles, algorithms — and illustrate how these are applied in real-world networks: from the Internet, over LPWAN through to the IoT.

Specifically, this course: 

* Offers a pragmatic and practical approach to communicating systems and to computer networking
* Studies, for each of the four major functional layers in a protocol stack (data-link, internetwork, transport, and application) the fundamental ideas, algorithms, and architectural principles, that apply “from the Internet, and to the IoT”
* Provides an in-depth tutorial in the principles behind TCP/IP Networking
* Introduces and decrypts modern Internet and IoT protocols: from IPv6 to 6LoWPAN, from ALOHA through Ethernet and WiFi to LoRa and Bluetooth — and from the WEB and REST to CORE And CoAP
* Provides practical experience in developing networked applications, and in developing and implementing protocols
